Title: Replication Package for: A Systematic Literature Review on Driving Developers’ Productivity through Enhanced Developer Experience: Factors, Practices, and Recommendations

Abstract: 

Context and Motivation. Developer eXperience (Dev-X) is a recent research area that focuses on developers perceptions, feelings, and values with respect to their role in the software development process. Research suggests that factors and practices related to Dev-X can have a substantial impact on developer productivity (Dev-P). However, despite a large and diverse body of literature on factors that can impact Dev-P in general, there is no coherent and comprehensive characterization of how Dev-X-specific insights can drive developer productivity. 

Aims. In the presented research, we aim to provide a coherent, comprehensive characterization of factors and practices related to Dev-X, with a particular focus on those factors and practices that potentially affect Dev-P. 

Approach. To this end, we performed a systematic literature review and identified 218 relevant papers in this area. We characterize the papers based on the related taxonomies and concepts common to Dev-X and Dev-P as presented in existing literature. To identify the relevant factors and practices, we employed a grounded-in-the-literature, theory-based content-analysis method.  

Results. We identify 33 Dev-X-related factors and 39 Dev-X-related practices. We grouped the factors and practices into ten Dev-XP themes to provide an organizing structure and to summarize how they can affect Dev-P. For each Dev-X factor, we identify attributes that might be used to assess/measure the current status (of an organization or project) regarding that factor and how that factor and its effects on productivity have been evidenced in the literature (mentioned vs. considered in questionaires vs. substantiated with a more positivist evaluation). We also offer some recommendations on how to translate these insights into industrial practice. Finally, our results point to areas where further research seems appropriate, i.e., where the evidence regarding Dev-X factors/practices is promising regarding its impact on Dev-P but not yet fully substantiated. 

Conclusions. Overall, the research presented here can contribute to an understanding of factors and practices related to Dev-X with a particular focus on those factors and practices that drive Dev-P. This is done through consideration of developers’ interests and well-being, rather than being limitated to organizational concerns or customer satisfaction, which are currently the more predominant perspectives applied in literature.
